# Tax calculator

Create a tax calculator that applies different tax rates depending on what state you enter.

The calculator accepts 3 inputs from the user:

- How many items are being purchased
- How much each item costs
- 2-letter state code

Output the total price. The total price is the number of items multiplied by the cost of each item, plus the tax percentage.

## Example:

```
Inputs:
How many items are being purchased? 978
How much does each item cost? 270.99
What state? UT

Processes:
Total: 265028.22
