# 01 Exercise - Thinking Like a Programmer

## Brief

Solve a programming problem without writing any code. This will help you to think like a programmer, and to better understand how to approach problem-solving.

## Getting started

1. Use the [Legal Driving Age Calculator Problem](problems/legal-driving-age-calculator/README.md) and the [solution](problems/legal-driving-age-calculator/solution.md) as a reference when completing this exercise.
2. Complete a solution for the [Tax Calculator Problem](problems/tax-calculator) by following the steps below.
3. Add your solution to `problems/tax-calculator/solution.md`. Copy the format from the [example solution](problems/legal-driving-age-calculator/solution.md). Look at the file in VS Code to see how the [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) works.

## Steps to follow

### Understanding the problem

One of the best ways to figure out what you have to do is to write it down. To help ensure you understand what to do, try writing out a problem statement that explains exactly what you're building. It should include all the information you need to solve the problem.

### Inputs, processes and outputs

Every program has inputs, processes, and outputs, whether it's simple or complex.

You can ensure your programs work well if you take the time to clearly state what these inputs, processes, and outputs are.

Look at your problem statement, and identify what information you need to gather, what information you need to output, and what process you need to follow to turn the input into the output.

### Test scenarios

One of the best ways to design and develop software is to think about the result you want to get right from the start.

Write down some test scenarios that test all the different types of inputs and expected outputs. It's good to try a range of inputs, even unexpected ones. For example, if you are expecting a number as an input, what happens if someone types in characters?

### Pseudo-code

Now you have a clear idea of the problem you are solving, and how the program should work, you can write out pretend code, commonly referred to as pseudo-code.

Pseudo-code lets you write out your logic in an English-like syntax. This lets you think through your problem in a programmatic style, without getting hung up on writing the programming language.

You can then use your pseudo-code as a reference when writing out your actual code. It makes programming much simpler.

Start by writing out the instructions you will need to tell your programming language to get the output you need. You need to think of every little step, including what information you need to store so you can retreieve it throughout your program.

There's no right way to write pseudo-code, although there are some widely used terms. You might use Initialize to state that you're setting an initial value, Prompt to say that you're prompting for input, and Display to indicate what you're displaying on the screen.
